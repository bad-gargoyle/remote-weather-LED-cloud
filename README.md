# remote-weather-LED-cloud
<B>Weather LED cloud based on Wemos D1 controlled remotely via HTTP url over WiFi</B>

Project is merged work of bitluni (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Dv70ci-MOw) and Ned Shelton (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hgXHqO7rQH8). Most of the following code is strictly their work. And I have to say, that both projects are great (Gentlemen, my thanks and much appreciation), but I missed the combination of a variety of lightning efects with the ability to controll it by a web server, so I decided to combine both projects into one and upload it onto Wemos D1 with intergated WiFi module. Although I am not strong in C ++ (I played with it a few years ago, so forgive not-so-clean-code or shortcomings), the effect is at least satisfactory (at least for me) and what is most important, I can now integrate the "weather cloud" with my OpenHAB. ;-) Why? To control it via Astro (https://www.openhab.org/addons/bindings/astro/) for example and display current, or maybe incoming weather conditions on it.
